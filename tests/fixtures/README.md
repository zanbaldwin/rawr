Do you know hard _hard_ it is to hunt the Archive for works with specific
attributes? Specific attributes like "work that has multiple authors that use
the same pseudonym"? Attributes that are **not** searchable?
And to avoid ones you already know about because you can go to hell if you
think I'm going to doxx myself and reveal the depraved fandoms I'm into.
